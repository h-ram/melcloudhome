## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-24

**Air-to-Water (ATW) heat pump support is now production-ready.**

### Added

**Air-to-Water (ATW) Heat Pump Support:**

- Climate platform for Zone 1 with heating/cooling\*, preset modes (Room/Flow/Curve), and temperature control (10-30°C)
- Water heater platform for DHW tank control (40-60°C, Eco/High demand modes)
- Switch platform for system power control
- Sensors: Zone 1 temperature, tank temperature, operation status, WiFi signal (RSSI), 6 telemetry sensors (flow/return temperatures)
- Energy monitoring\*: Sensors for consumed energy (kWh), produced energy (kWh), and COP (efficiency ratio) - compatible with Home Assistant Energy Dashboard
- Binary sensors: Error state, connection state, forced DHW mode indicator
- 3-way valve logic with automatic priority management between space heating and DHW
- Capability-based feature detection for energy monitoring and cooling mode

\*Feature availability auto-detected from device capabilities.

**Development Tools:**

- Local Docker Compose development environment with mock API server (2 ATA + 1 ATW test devices)
- Automated deployment tool for remote testing

### Changed

- **ATA Climate State Attributes Now Lowercase** - State values for `fan_mode`, `swing_mode`, and `swing_horizontal_mode` are now lowercase per Home Assistant standards.
- **Migration required:** Change `state_attr('climate.entity', 'fan_mode') == 'Auto'` → `== 'auto'`
- Entity naming pattern updated to `has_entity_name=True` for Home Assistant compatibility. Device names now show friendly locations (e.g., "Living Room") instead of UUIDs. Entity IDs include descriptive suffixes (e.g., `_climate`, `_zone_1`, `_tank`). Existing installations: Entity IDs preserved, device names automatically updated.

### Fixed

- Request pacing prevents 429 errors when scenes/automations control multiple devices simultaneously (minimum 500ms spacing between API requests)
- Water heater temperature control respects device capability (whole degree vs half degree steps)
- "Recreate entity ID" button now generates stable IDs instead of breaking automations
- Memory leak in config flow - Client sessions now properly closed when login fails

## [2.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-01-23

**Beta Release: Authentication and Performance Fixes**

### Fixed

- **Reauth flow after power outages** - Integration now automatically recovers when credentials expire instead of getting stuck in broken state (Fixes #39)
  - Added Home Assistant reauth flow support (`async_step_reauth`, `async_step_reauth_confirm`)
  - Handles "already authenticated" edge case when auth cookies outlive API session
  - Prompts user to re-enter password when authentication fails
  - No more manual reconfiguration or HA restart required after power outages

- **Memory leak in config flow** - Client sessions are now properly closed when login fails during setup, reauth, or reconfigure
  - Previously leaked aiohttp ClientSession, TCP connections, memory buffers, and SSL contexts with each failed login attempt
  - Added `try-finally` pattern to ensure `client.close()` always called
  - Affects user setup, reauth, and reconfigure flows

- **Login performance** - Removed unnecessary 3-second delay after OAuth login
  - Chrome DevTools testing confirmed session is ready immediately after OAuth redirect
  - Login now completes as soon as OAuth finishes (3 seconds faster)
  - Affects initial setup, reauth after credential expiration, and reconfiguration

### Changed

- Mock server now validates passwords for authentication testing (accepts any password except 'WRONG_PASSWORD')

## [2.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-01-23

**Major Release: Air-to-Water (ATW) Heat Pump Support**

### Added

**Air-to-Water (ATW) Heat Pump Support:**

- **Climate Platform** (Zone 1): Heating/cooling*control, temperature setting (10-30°C), preset modes (Room/Flow/Curve), HVAC modes (OFF/HEAT/COOL*)
- **Water Heater Platform** (DHW Tank): Temperature control (40-60°C), operation modes (Eco/High demand)
- **Switch Platform** (System Power): Primary power control
- **Sensors**: Zone 1 temperature, tank temperature, operation status, WiFi signal (RSSI), 6 telemetry sensors (flow/return temperatures)
- **Energy Monitoring\***: Energy consumed (kWh), energy produced (kWh), COP (efficiency ratio) - compatible with Home Assistant Energy Dashboard
- **Binary Sensors**: Error state, connection state, forced DHW mode active
- **3-Way Valve Logic**: Automatic priority management between space heating and DHW
- **Capability-Based Features**: Energy monitoring and cooling mode auto-detected from device capabilities

\*Feature availability depends on device capabilities

**Tested Devices:**

- ERSCVM2D: Full features (heating, cooling, energy monitoring, telemetry)
- EHSCVM2D: Core features (heating-only, telemetry, no energy monitoring)

**Development Tools:**

- Local Docker Compose development environment with mock API server (2 ATA + 1 ATW test devices)
- Mock server supports energy, RSSI, and cooling endpoints
- Automated deployment tool for remote testing
- Upgrade verification tooling

### Changed

- Entity naming pattern updated to use `has_entity_name=True` for Home Assistant compatibility
  - Device names show friendly locations (e.g., "Living Room") instead of UUIDs
  - Entity IDs include descriptive suffixes (e.g., `_climate`, `_zone_1`, `_tank`)
  - Existing installations: Entity IDs preserved, device names automatically updated
  - No action required for existing users

- **ATA Climate State Attributes Now Lowercase**
  - State values for `fan_mode`, `swing_mode`, and `swing_horizontal_mode` are now lowercase per HA standards
  - Migration: Change `state_attr('climate.entity', 'fan_mode') == 'Auto'` → `== 'auto'`

### Fixed

- **Rate limiting:** Add request pacing to prevent 429 errors when scenes/automations control multiple devices simultaneously. The integration now enforces a minimum 500ms spacing between API requests, preventing MELCloud from rejecting rapid-fire requests. This is especially important for ATW heat pump devices which have multiple entities (zones + DHW + power) that may be controlled together.
- ATW zones showing IDLE when actively heating - added support for undocumented `"Heating"` operation status
- Water heater temperature control respects device capability (whole degree vs half degree steps)
- "Recreate entity ID" button now generates stable IDs instead of breaking automations
- Zone 1 heating status display - correctly shows HEATING when valve serves zone
- Blank icon button labels in thermostat cards for ATA and ATW

### Changed

- Internal documentation cleanup

## [1.3.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- LICENSE badge in README (removed clickable link to prevent HACS from creating malformed URLs)

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added

- **Automatic session recovery**: Climate service calls now automatically recover from session expiry with retry and re-authentication
- **Debounced coordinator refresh**: Prevents race conditions when scenes or automations make multiple rapid service calls
- **Smart deduplication**: Skips redundant API calls when values haven't changed, reducing API load by ~70% for typical scene activation
- **Enhanced deployment tool**: Improved reliability with retry logic and better error diagnostics

### Fixed

- **Session expiry errors**: Climate service calls no longer fail with "Session expired" errors
- **Race conditions**: Multiple rapid service calls from scenes now properly debounce refresh to prevent stale state
- **Duplicate API calls**: Eliminated redundant calls (e.g., vanes being set 3x with same values)
- **Energy polling exception handling**: Authentication failures now properly trigger repair UI instead of being silently logged
- **Deployment tool**: Fixed intermittent SSH failures when running under `uv run`

### Changed

- **Authentication failure notification**: Auth failures now immediately show repair UI (instead of retry with backoff) for faster user notification
