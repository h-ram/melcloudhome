Home Assistant custom integration for **MELCloud Home**.

## What's New in v2.1.0

Outdoor temperature sensor for ATA air conditioning units. Automatically discovered from device capabilities, updated every 30 minutes. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Features

### Air-to-Air (ATA) - Air Conditioning

- Full climate control (power, temperature, modes, fan speeds, vane directions)
- Energy monitoring with Home Assistant Energy Dashboard support
- Real-time sensors (room temperature, outdoor temperature*, WiFi signal, connection status)
- 60-second polling for climate updates, 30-minute for outdoor temperature

*Auto-detected from device capabilities - not all units have outdoor temperature sensors

### Air-to-Water (ATW) - Heat Pumps

- Zone 1 & Zone 2 climate control with preset modes (Room/Flow/Curve) - Zone 2 auto-detected
- DHW tank control via water heater platform
- System power switch
- Multiple sensors (temperatures, operation status, 6 telemetry sensors)
- Energy monitoring* (consumed, produced, COP - Energy Dashboard compatible)
- Cooling mode* (Cool Room/Cool Flow presets)

*Auto-detected from device capabilities - see [docs/entities.md](docs/entities.md) for details

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.11.0 or newer
- MELCloud Home account with configured devices
- Internet connection for cloud API access

## Supported Devices

### Air-to-Air (ATA) - Air Conditioning Units

This integration supports Mitsubishi Electric air conditioning units connected via **MELCloud Home** WiFi adapters (MAC-5xx series).

**Supported systems:** Wall-mounted splits, ducted systems, and console units tested and working.

> **Note:** If your system uses the classic **MELCloud** app (not MELCloud Home), use the official Home Assistant MELCloud integration instead.

For complete hardware compatibility including specific models, WiFi adapters, and technical notes, see [SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md](SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md).

### Air-to-Water (ATW) - Heat Pumps

- **Status:** Production-ready (tested on real hardware)
- **Supported systems:** Mitsubishi Electric Ecodan heat pumps with FTC controllers
- **Core features:** Zone 1 & Zone 2 heating, DHW control, 3-way valve systems, telemetry sensors, energy monitoring*
- **Optional features:** Cooling mode (capability-based), energy monitoring (capability-based)

*Feature availability auto-detected from device capabilities

For tested controller models and capability details, see [SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md](SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md).

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=andrew-blake&repository=melcloudhome&category=integration)

Or manually: HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories → add `https://github.com/andrew-blake/melcloudhome`

After adding, find "MELCloud Home" in HACS, click "Download", and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/andrew-blake/melcloudhome/releases)
2. Extract the `melcloudhome` folder to your `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=melcloudhome)

Or manually: **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → search "MELCloud Home"

Enter your MELCloud Home credentials (email and password). Your devices will be automatically discovered and added.

## Important Notes

### Stable Entity IDs

This integration uses **UUID-based entity IDs** to ensure automations never break when device names change. Entity IDs follow the format `{domain}.melcloudhome_{short_id}_{entity_name}` where `short_id` is derived from the device UUID.

**Device names** are set to friendly names from your MELCloud Home account (e.g., "Living Room").

**⚠️ Warning:** If you delete entities and use the "Recreate entity IDs" option, entity IDs will change to name-based IDs (e.g., `climate.living_room_climate`), breaking automations. To preserve IDs, delete and re-add the integration instead.

See [docs/entities.md](docs/entities.md) for complete entity ID reference.

## Entities

The integration creates the following entities for each device:

**Air-to-Air (ATA) Systems:**

- Climate control (HVAC modes, temperature, fan speeds, swing)
- Sensors (room temperature, outdoor temperature*, WiFi signal, energy consumption)
- Binary sensors (error state, connection status)

**Air-to-Water (ATW) Heat Pumps:**

- Climate control (Zone 1 & Zone 2 heating/cooling with preset modes)
- Water heater (DHW tank control)
- System power switch
- Sensors (temperatures, operation status, telemetry, WiFi signal, energy*)
- Binary sensors (error state, connection status, forced DHW active)

*Energy monitoring auto-detected from device capabilities

**Complete entity reference:** See [docs/entities.md](docs/entities.md) for detailed entity IDs, control options, and configuration examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Loading

- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Verify your MELCloud Home credentials
- Ensure devices are configured in the MELCloud Home app

### Entities Not Updating

- Check your internet connection
- Verify MELCloud Home service is accessible
- Review the integration logs for API errors

### Energy Sensor Unavailable

- Some devices may not report energy data
- Check if device shows energy consumption in the MELCloud Home app
- Energy sensors require 30 minutes for initial data

### Export Diagnostics

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find "MELCloud Home" integration
3. Click the three dots and select "Download diagnostics"
4. Share the file when reporting issues

## API Rate Limiting

The integration uses conservative polling intervals to respect API limits:

- **Climate/Sensors**: 60 seconds
- **Energy Data**: 30 minutes
- **Outdoor Temperature**: 30 minutes

These intervals balance update frequency with API rate limits.
