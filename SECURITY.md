- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected file(s) and location in code (if known)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if applicable)

The more details you provide, the faster we can address the issue.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 72 hours

### Contributing a Fix

If you're able to develop a fix for the vulnerability, security-related pull requests are welcome and appreciated. Please coordinate with us first via the security advisory to ensure we're aligned on the approach.

### Security Update Process

1. Vulnerability is reported and confirmed
2. Fix is developed and tested
3. New version is released with security patch
4. Security advisory is published
5. Users are notified via GitHub release notes

## Security Best Practices

When using this integration:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version available through HACS
2. **Secure Credentials**: Never share your MELCloud credentials or Home Assistant access tokens
3. **Network Security**: Ensure your Home Assistant instance is properly secured
4. **Review Logs**: Check Home Assistant logs regularly for suspicious activity
5. **Report Issues**: If you notice unusual behavior, report it immediately

## Additional Information

- This integration uses cloud polling and does not expose local network services
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Credentials are stored in Home Assistant's config entry storage on the local filesystem — securing the host machine is important
- No user data is collected or transmitted beyond what's required for MELCloud API communication
